# BBNJ Conference Speech Data
## Natural Language Processing with spacyr

This project models ocean health within a country's marine jurisdiction (as measured by the Ocean Health Index) using the country's speeches at meetings of the UN Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdictions conference.

I scraped the speech data from the BBNJ website and downloaded and read in the contents of speech pdf documents. I used spacy to process the text in the scraped and tidied dataset (include lemmatization and part of speech tagging).

I created this because I've been interested in BBNJ agreement progress over the last few years. The project is still in progress - I finished most of the modelling but haven't finished a complete writeup yet. Better file organization also to come.
